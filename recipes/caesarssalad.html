<p>I have <strong>never</strong> actually made a Caesar's salad on my own</p>
<p>I mean, can you even blame me? I am a student. <em>Anchovies?</em> Where am I even going to find anchovies?</p>
<p>I am sorry, I really am but just order it as a takeout order like a normal person and don't cook it on your own you twisted psychopath.</p> <p><b>WHO EVEN MAKES A CAESAR'S SALAD</b></p>
